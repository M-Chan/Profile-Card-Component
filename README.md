## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
-I learnt how to create a more responsive webpage by writing a new stylesheet for a mobile view using the following code...

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 400px){
  /* code for mobile layout here */
}
```

### Continued development & Issues
-I would like to focus on making websites more responsive to different screen sizes and platforms.
-There were issues with making the mobile version as the circles are not in the right place and it is scrolling so the webpage size is not right
-With more practice, I also hope to get used to the code and hence become quicker for Hackathons
